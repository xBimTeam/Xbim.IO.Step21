# Xbim.IO.Step21

Fast Express STEP part 21 parsing in .NET

## Description

We want to make xbim parsing better, faster and stronger, so we have hand written a custom parser in C# instead of relying on
the one generated by GPPG.

This is a basic implementation at the moment, but does parse sample models with no problems, and appears much faster and
maintainable than the old version.

## Done

- [x] Solves the int32 limit of file parsing with GPPG.
- [x] Make it fast enough.

## Todo

- [ ] Determine minumum public API profile
- [ ] Add XML documentation comments to all public members.
- [ ] Should we use events for the instantiation of classes in from a consuming assembly?
- [ ] Should we retain SyntaxTrivia (e.g. spaces and comments)? They are currently dropped when parsing.
